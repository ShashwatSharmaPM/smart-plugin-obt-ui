# Smart UI Plugin & Analytics

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a smart plugin designed to enhance the user interface of multiple booking platforms by dynamically embedding additional information based on the platform context. The plugin also tracks user interactions with different UI elements to inform data-driven product decisions and improve the user experience over time.

Key features include:
- Adaptive behavior to recognize different booking platforms (OBTs) and adjust UI elements.
- Dynamic display of additional contextual information.
- Analytics tracking to understand how users interact with the enhanced UI.

## Key Responsibilities & Deliverables
As Product Manager, responsibilities included:
- Defining the product vision and roadmap for the plugin.
- Collaborating with developers to design a smart plugin adaptable to multiple platforms.
- Ensuring accurate display of contextual information within the booking platforms.
- Designing tracking mechanisms for user interactions with various UI elements.
- Analyzing usage data to iterate on UI design and feature prioritization.

Deliverables:
- Functional plugin demonstrating platform-adaptive UI.
- Analytics framework tracking user engagement and interactions.
- Documentation detailing the plugin features, analytics metrics, and design decisions.
